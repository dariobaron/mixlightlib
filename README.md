# mixlightlib

This C++ library aims to supply a header-only lightweight tool for general (but somewhat recurrent) scientific needs. This is a collection of algorithms and data structures that I repeatedly needed during my scientific career.

As any header-only library, it does not require any installation. The directory `include` in this repository must only be added to the include-path of the compiler.
